* Part One: Introduction to Solaris Internals
** Chapter 1 - Introduction
This chapter summarize key features of Solaris and take a overview of the major subsystems as a warm-up to the detailed dicussions that follow in the rest of the book.
*** Solaris key areas of innovation and development
- Reliability
- Performance and scalability
- Manageability
- Observability
- Resource management
*** Key features of Solaris
- UFS (Solaris/UNIX File System)
- DISM (Dynamic Intimate Shared Memory)
- SMF (Service Management Framework)
- Zones (Solaris Containers)
  - Software partitioning technology
  - Each zone is isolated from other zones
- DTrace (Dynamic tracing facility)
  - Software sensor
  - Induce performance regression
- X64 arch support
- IPv6 since Solaris 8, Feb 2000
- RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
- ...
*** Kernel overview
- Managing the hardware
- Supplying a set of system services
- Process & Thread
- System calls
- Key components
  - System call interface (API)
  - Process execution & scheduling
  - Memory management
  - Resource management
  - File system
  - I/O bus and device management
  - Kernel facilities
  - Networking
- Core Kernel + Loadable Modules (7 module types)
*** Major subsystem overview
**** Processes, Threads, and Scheduling
- Kernel (thread) & User process (thread)\\
  Switching execution between threads within the same process is inexpensive, since a virtual memory context switching is not required.
- Nucleus of the Solaris kernel thread model
  - Kernel threads
  - User threads
  - Process
  - LWP (Lightweight process)\\
    The kernel-visible execution context for a user thread.
- Thread Model\\
  user thread ↝ LWP ↝ kernel thread
  #+begin_src sh
  # Solaris 8
  /usr/lib/libthread.so (default, user thread - LWP pool - kernel thread)
  /usr/lib/lwp/libthread.so (alternate, user thread - LWP - kernel thread)
  # Solaris 9 and later
  /usr/lib/lwp/libthread.so (default, new model)
  /usr/lib/libthread.so (alternate, old model)
  #+end_src
  old thread model drawbacks
  - user threads were multiplexed onto a potentially smaller pool of LWPs
  - required maintaining a runnable thread queue and user thread scheduler at the threads library level
  - a user thread need to be bound to an LWP before the kernel could schedule it to run on a processor
  - maintaining a library-level threads scheduler was enormously complex.
  - additionally, maintaining correct asynchronous signal behavior in the two-level module was quite challenging \\
  since a user thread that is not masking a posted signal may not be on an LWP when the system attempts to deliver the signal.
  - finally, issues with concurrency management and scheduling latency could result in suboptimal performance for threaded applications.
  - the scheduling latency was the effect of waiting for the thread library scheduler to link a user thread to an available LWP
  - the concurrency issue has to do with maintaining a sufficient number of LWPs such that the process does not have runnable user threads waiting for an execution resource (an LWP)
  new thread model benefits
  - Improved performance, scalability and reliability
  - Reliable signal behavior
  - Improved adaptive mutex lock implementation
  - User-level sleep queues for asynchronization objects\\
  global process priorities and scheduling\\
  The Solaris kernel implements a global =thread priority model= for kernel threads.\\
  The kernel scheduler, or =dispatcher= use the model to decide which kernel thread execute next.\\ Total 170 global priorities, and 7 scheduling classes, higher value means higher priority.
  - TS (Time Share Scheduling Class) [DEFAULT] priority change dynamically [0-59]
  - IA (Enhanced TS, Interactive Scheduling Class, GUI) current focus window has higher priority [0-59]
  - FSS (Fair Share Scheduling Class) not priority-based
  - FX (Fixed Priority Scheduling Class) priority not change [0-59]
  - SYS (System Scheduling Class) [60-99]
  - RT (Real Time Scheduling Class) [100-160]
  - Interrupts [160-169]
**** Interprocess Communication
**** Signals
**** Memory Management
**** Files and File Systems
